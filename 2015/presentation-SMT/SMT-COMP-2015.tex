\begin{frame}{Competition Tools Improved}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed an issue where the \structure{trace executor} would
    sometimes not count correct solver responses on partially solved
    incremental benchmarks. (Thanks to Kshitij Bansal for reporting
    this.)

    \bigskip

  \item Fixed several issues in the \structure{benchmark scrambler}
    that caused invalid output in the presence of variable shadowing.

\begin{frame}{Further Thoughts}
  Benchmarks:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Still more benchmarks needed, especially for small divisions
  \item Resolve semantics of partial operations, e.g., {\tt bvdiv},
    {\tt fp.min}
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip

  Solvers:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Parallelism
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip

  Competition:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Relative weight of benchmarks and benchmark families
  \item Separate measure of performance on quick jobs
  \item Additional tracks, e.g., unsat-core, proofs
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip

  Teams:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \structure{Congratulations on your accomplishments!}
  \item \structure{Thanks for your participation!}
