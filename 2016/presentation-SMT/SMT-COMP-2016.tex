\begin{frame}{Important Rule Changes}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \structure{SMT-LIB~2.5} instead of~2.0
    \begin{itemize}
    \item SMT-LIB not fully migrated yet
    \item Fortunately, largely backwards-compatible
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
  \item Size-based \structure{weighting of benchmark families} within
    divisions:
    $$1 + \log_e |F|$$
    Small benchmark families are more important than before.
    \bigskip
  \item \structure{Unsat-core track} reinstated

\begin{frame}{Further Thoughts}
  Benchmarks:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Still more benchmarks needed, especially for small divisions
  \item Resolve semantics of partial operations, e.g., {\tt bvdiv},
    {\tt fp.min}
  \item Benchmark curation deserves better tool support
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip

  Competition:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Benchmark weights---good or bad?
  \item Integration of benchmarks with unknown status?
  \item Trophies? (T-shirts? Dinner? Funding?!)
