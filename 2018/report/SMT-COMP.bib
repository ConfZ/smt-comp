abstract="This paper describes a novel decision procedure for quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic. Standard techniques usually relax the initial problem to the rational domain and then proceed either by projection (e.g.Omega-Test) or by branching/cutting methods (branch-and-bound, branch-and-cut, Gomory cuts). Our approach tries to bridge the gap between the two techniques: it interleaves an exhaustive search for a model with bounds inference. These bounds are computed provided an oracle capable of finding constant positive linear combinations of affine forms. We also show how to design an efficient oracle based on the Simplex procedure. Our algorithm is proved sound, complete, and terminating and is implemented in the alt-ergo theorem prover. Experimental results are promising and show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art SMT solvers.",
