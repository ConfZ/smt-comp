This text file documents the public web pages of the SMT-COMP web site.
Particularly it describes changes needed when creating a new website for a 
new year.

Created: David R. Cok - 9 January 2012

Top-level organization:

The top-level (in smtcomp-web) holds a directory for each year and a set of
utility files. The utility files are images and css files; these do not
change from year to year. The files in a subdirectory for a given year are
not changed after that year's competition is complete; rather, a new copy of the
files is created and appropriate edits are performed.

To create a web-site for a new year:
- create the subdirectory for that year
- change the link in smtcomp-web/index.html so that the new year is the default
- copy all the files from the previous year
- edit the files as described below

WHAT ABOUT THESE:
bench_selection.shtml
select_benchmarks_20XX.c
TreeLimitedRun.c

Major edits needed

application.shtml - edit any changes to the benchmark sets

callXX.txt - rename the file for the current year and edit as appropriate for
  the new call

rules.shtml
rules.pdf

Minor edits needed:

acknowledgements.shtml - change date, organiers, and any other competition
  details that are changing

docs.shtml - no year-dependent edits; new papers should be added as they are
  published

index.shtml - update the date and the organizers; the page also includes
  news and other progress, so is likely updated frequently throughout the 
  time leading up to the competition (and after)

introduction.shtml - update the list of previous competitions

navbar.html - the link to the list of competitors and the link to Results may 
  need updating

notfound.shtml - update the name of the web-site contact

participants.shtml - update to the new list of participants

previous.shtml - add the previous year to the list of previous year links

smt-comp-prelude.shtml - change the author list as needed
tools.shtml - lists tools available for working with SMT-COMP and SMT-LIB files;
  no changes are needed year-by-year, but add entries as new tools are
  announced

No edits needed:
smt-comp-postlude.shtml
smt-style.css
valid-css.png
valid-xhtml10.png
